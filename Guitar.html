		<br>
		<br>
		<p align="center">When I was a kid, I would always be fascinated by all the guitarists that I would see on TV. You could say it was what made me want to learn guitar in the first place. I asked my mom if I could get a Guitar and take classes and she agreed. </p>

		<br>

		<p align="center">I was put into a music school near the place I lived(apart from my normal day school of course) at the age of 7 where for some reason I had to start with a xylophone in order to learn music notes and very basic music theory... And I hated it. After a year, I finally got to buy a guitar and join Guitar classes. I started with a cheap 3/4 classical guitar and the songs I would learn were extremely boring. I would learn stuff like positions, but was never told how it affects the song. Eventually I started to lose interest and stopped practising.</p>

		<br>

		<p align="center">I told my mom that I found these classes extremely boring after 2 years of suffering, and she changed my guitar teacher. This teacher was more or less the same. The songs he would give me were more popular and fun to play, but this time, no music theory was taught to me... like literally nothing. I ended up leaving that teacher as well after 2 years. </p>

		<br>

		<p align="center">At this point I was barely playing guitar, and I wasn't even good at it even though ive played for over 4 years now. I didn't know chords or how they formed, and I pretty much never used my pinky on my left, or my ring finger on my right.</p>

		<br>

		<p align="center">Once I reached 8th grade in my school, my school held an annual function, and there was a musical event included as part of the function. My teacher asked if I could play any instrument, and I said yes, and hence, I was asked to take part in the event. I was asked to play a song called "love story", AKA "where do i begin" as the pianist knew how to play that and it sounded great. So i spent the next few days learning the song and practising it over and over again. That's when I started liking it again. </p>

		<br>

		<p align="center"> Once the function was over, I kept practising guitar and I would learn a new song here and there. Later that year, I wanted an electrical guitar, as that was what I wanted as a kid, and it looked cool, and I thought it had many cool effects (which is true, but it requires pedals for those that cost a lot). My mom got me an electrical guitar from yamaha that came with an amp, a cable, a strap, an extra pack of strings, and picks. I loved it, but I had no idea what all the settings did.</p>

		<br>

		<p align="center"> I started to learn on my own. I would go on youtube and search for easy riffs to learn. As I was going through youtube, I found out about fingerstyle and percussive fingerstyle and was very intrigued towards it. Thats when I picked my classical guitar back up and started learning various pop song guitar covers. I got really good at it, to a point where i could say that I was above average in fingerstyle.</p>

		<br>

		<p align="center"> I kept playing fingerstyle for a few more years, even when I went from Iran to a hostel in India. I stayed there for a year, but then covid struck and I had to go back to Iran without my classical guitar as the airlines wouldn't let me bring it with me.</p>

		<br>

		<p align="center"> Once I got back to Iran, I started learning songs on my electric guitar. I got obsessed over polyphia, Tim Henson and Ichika Nito and would watch their videos for hours. I started to learn a ton of Polyphia songs and i started to improve extremely fast.
